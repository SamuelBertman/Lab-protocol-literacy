## Step-by-Step Learning Plan with Application Showcase

### 1. Read and Understand Material Spec Sheets  
- **Learn:** Find and study example spec sheets for polymers, ceramics, or composites. Learn key terms and parameters.  
- **Apply:** Create concise notes or flashcards explaining important terms and why they matter for material choice.  
- **Showcase:**  
  - Upload notes/flashcards as markdown or PDFs to `/LabProtocolLiteracy/SpecSheets` on GitHub.  
  - Add a markdown summary explaining how spec sheets guide materials design.  
  - Mention this skill in your CV under a “Technical Skills” section.

### 2. Learn Lab Safety & MSDS Interpretation  
- **Learn:** Study MSDS documents for common lab chemicals and watch lab safety videos.  
- **Apply:** Write a one-page summary explaining hazard codes, handling, and emergency info.  
- **Showcase:**  
  - Upload MSDS summaries to `/LabProtocolLiteracy/MSDS` in your repo.  
  - Include reflections on why safety knowledge is critical for materials research.  
  - Reference this in your CV or personal statement to demonstrate responsibility and lab-readiness.

### 3. Study Synthesis Procedures (sol-gel, CVD)  
- **Learn:** Read open courseware lab manuals for step-by-step synthesis methods.  
- **Apply:** Create clear, illustrated flowcharts or stepwise protocols of these procedures.  
- **Showcase:**  
  - Add flowcharts and explanations in `/LabProtocolLiteracy/Synthesis`.  
  - Write a blog post or LinkedIn article summarizing the synthesis process and applications in your project.  
  - Link these in your CV/projects section.

### 4. Learn Thermal Analysis Techniques (DSC, TGA, XRD)  
- **Learn:** Study the theory and watch tutorial videos on these techniques.  
- **Apply:** Interpret sample data plots and write short reports explaining what the data reveals about materials.  
- **Showcase:**  
  - Upload reports and sample data plots in `/LabProtocolLiteracy/ThermalAnalysis`.  
  - Add visual diagrams explaining each technique’s role.  
  - Mention this in CV under “Analytical Techniques” or similar.

### 5. Explore Surface Science Methods (AFM, SEM, TEM)  
- **Learn:** Watch videos and read about what these microscopy methods show.  
- **Apply:** Summarize the principles and create a comparison table of AFM, SEM, and TEM capabilities.  
- **Showcase:**  
  - Add summaries and comparison tables in `/LabProtocolLiteracy/SurfaceScience`.  
  - Include links and notes from YouTube channels watched with key takeaways.  
  - Reference in CV and personal statement as part of your broad materials characterization knowledge.

## General Tips to Document & Present Your Progress:
- Maintain a clean **GitHub repo structure** with meaningful README files in each folder summarizing your work.  
- Regularly write **short blog posts or LinkedIn articles** explaining each topic in your own words.  
- Include **visuals like flowcharts, tables, and diagrams** to improve clarity and impact.  
- Link your GitHub and blog in your **CV/resume** under relevant skills and projects.  
- Use your learning reflections and summaries as **talking points in interviews** to demonstrate initiative and deep understanding.
